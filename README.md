# AutoSentry
Raspberry Pi motion capture system to be place on car dashboard. Sends images of changes in view to email recipients. Uses picam.py (modified) from https://github.com/skl/raspberry-pi-cam/blob/master/picam.py. picam.py is converted to executable and is triggered by cronjob running AutoSentry.py. This is so that you can control how often you get emails.
